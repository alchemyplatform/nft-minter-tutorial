# üìù NFT Minter Tutorial Files

This repository contains the starter files (`minter-starter-files`) and completed version (`nft-tutorial`) of Alchemy's [NFT Minter tutorial](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter).

When you open this cloned nft-minter-tutorial repository, you'll notice that it contains two folders: minter-starter-files and nft-minter.

* `minter-starter-files` contains the starter files (essentially the React UI) for this project. In this tutorial, we will be working in this directory, as you learn how to bring this UI to life by connecting it to your Ethereum wallet and an NFT smart contract.
* `nft-minter` contains the entire completed tutorial and is there for you as a reference if you get stuck.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the tutorial

In this beginner-level tutorial, we'll teach you how to connect your smart contract to your React dApp project by building an NFT Minter using Metamask and Web3.

## ü§î Note

Neither the `minter-starter-files` nor the `nft-tutorial` have their `node_modules` folder. So before running `npm start` in your terminal to start the React project, you need to run `npm install` to download all the package dependencies.
